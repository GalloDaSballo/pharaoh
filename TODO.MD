## Realistic Goals
- Use the same Regex in string-regex to allow copy pasting the interesting stuff instead of the title with extra stuff
- Store and show common regexes, to re-use them
- Figure out an algo to auto-figure out the regexes

## Stretch Goals
- Once string-regex is fully tested, we can add it to this, allowing judging and scoring via the UI
- Fetch all reports via one line of text (URL) and one click
- Connect Pharaoh to String-Regex ## Prob too opinionated to make it viable anytime soon
